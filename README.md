Assignment â€“ Photo contest

This assignment adds another feature to your blog website which will collect and save user data and an image to the database as part of a hypothetical photo contest.

Add a link to the contest in the main navigation bar which will take users to a page describing the contest and containing a form in which they can upload their information and photo submission.

The required pieces of information to gather from the user are

    Their name
    Their email address
    An image

In addition to the information gathered, also save the date & time of the submission.

Register the model in the Django admin and customize its presentation so it can be sorted, filtered, etc. by a staff member of your site.
Hints

    To upload files in a form you must set the encoding to "multipart/form-data" by adding the following to the <form> tag: <form enctype="multipart/form-data" ... >
